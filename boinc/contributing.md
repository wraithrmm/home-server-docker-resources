First of all, thank you for contributing to my project.  I'm glad that you've found it usefull and you've decided to enhance it.

The recommended way to contribute is as follows:

* Fork the project & clone locally.
* Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before you branch.
* Branch for each separate piece of work.
* Do the work, write good commit messages, and read the CONTRIBUTING file if there is one.
* Push to your origin repository.
* Create a new PR in GitHub.
* Respond to any code review feedback.

I've use this a few times in contributing to some projects.  Let me know if you need any assistance.
